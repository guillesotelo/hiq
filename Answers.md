# HiQ Coding Test

## Technologies

For this particular coding test, I decided to go for the FullStack way, using React and Node for building the entire app.
In addition, using these technologies:

### React

* TypeScript: built components and functions using types.
* Axios: for managing the API calls.
* React-Router: routing structure.
* Sass: style sheets with nesting classes.
  
### Node

* Morgan: parsing some logs for development.
* Express: built a simple server and its routes.
* PM2: controlling the server and logs.

## Q&A

1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?

    I spent around 5-6 hours in total.

2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

    First of all, I decided to split the backend and frontend into different folders, keeping things in their place (I tend to always split into different repos for full-stack apps).

    I used a standard way of structuring the folders on both ends and also separated everything into modules.
    Since this isn't a large app, It only aims for scalability and easy reading. I also choose meaningful variable and function names.

1. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

    There are two things I'd like to improve in this app.
    One is to better process the text files, expanding all kinds of text formats and extensions.
    I'd also like to have proper unit test cases. After spending some time configuring basic tests I ran into some module types errors and couldn't test the app properly.

2. What did you think of this recruitment test?

    I think it was a really fun way to do the test. Having wide liberty to choose and explain the technologies is definitely the highlight.
